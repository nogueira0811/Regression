# Regression Analysis of Mortality Rates across U.S. Cities

## Overview

This project examines the relationship between age-adjusted mortality rates and 15 key variables (e.g., climate, socioeconomic conditions, and pollution) across 60 U.S. cities. Multiple regression techniques are used to identify significant contributors to mortality rates.

## Key Features

- **Climate**: temperature, precipitation, etc.
- **Socioeconomic**: education, income, population, etc.
- **Pollution**: environmental factors and pollution indices.
- **Final Regression Model**: Identifies the most significant contributors to mortality.
