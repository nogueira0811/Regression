# Regression Analysis on Mortality and Environmental Factors #
This project investigates the relationship between total age-adjusted mortality and various predictor variables such as climate, socioeconomic factors and pollution across 60 U.S. cities, using data from a 1973 study by McDonald and Schwing. The analysis is performed using multiple regression techniques to identify significant factors influencing mortality rates.

## Features ##
15 predictor variables including: 
+ Climate (e.g., temperature, precipitation)
+ Socioeconomic (e.g., education, population)
+ Pollution indicators

Final fitted regression model based on the analysis.
