# Regression Analysis of Key Variables Influencing Mortality Rates

This project explores the relationship between age-adjusted mortality rates and 15 key variables (e.g., climate, socioeconomic conditions, and pollution) across 60 U.S. cities using data from a 1973 study by McDonald and Schwing. Multiple regression techniques are applied to identify significant contributors to mortality rates.

## Features

The analysis includes 15 predictors, such as:
- **Climate**: temperature, precipitation, etc.
- **Socioeconomic**: education, population, income, etc.
- **Pollution**: pollution indices and environmental factors.

The final regression model highlights the most significant contributors to mortality.
