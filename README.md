## Regression Analysis for Mortality Rates Across 60 US Cities ##

In 1973, McDonald and Schwing introduced a dataset focusing on total mortality across 60 US cities in 1960. This project aims to conduct regression analysis using total age-adjusted mortality 
as the response variable. The analysis will explore correlations with fifteen selected predictor variables, including factors such as climate, socioeconomic conditions, and pollution.
